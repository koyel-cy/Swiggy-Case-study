# Swiggy Case Study

## Overview

This project delves into a Swiggy-inspired dataset using SQL queries to uncover insights about user behavior, restaurant performance, and food preferences. The dataset comprises three core entities: **users**, **food**, and **restaurants**, with their interactions managed by the **orders** table. By addressing a series of key questions, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this case study are to analyze user behavior, evaluate restaurant performance, and understand food preferences. Through a variety of SQL queries, we seek to address questions across different aspects of the dataset.

## Key Questions Explored

1. Identify customers who have never placed an order.
2. Calculate the average price per dish.
3. Determine the top restaurant based on the number of orders for a given month.
4. Find restaurants with monthly sales exceeding a specific threshold.
5. Retrieve orders with detailed information for a particular customer within a defined date range.
6. Identify restaurants with the highest number of returning customers.
7. Analyze the month-over-month revenue growth of Swiggy.
8. Determine customers' favorite foods.

## Data Structure

The dataset centers around three core entities:

- **users**: Contains customer information.
- **food**: Encompasses data about available food items.
- **restaurants**: Holds information about different dining establishments.

The **orders** table establishes relationships:

- **orders**: Connects users with restaurants, serving as a link between them. It also associates food items with restaurants via a menu.

## Conclusion

By harnessing SQL queries, this case study extracts meaningful insights from the Swiggy-like dataset. The results contribute to informed decision-making, enhanced user experiences, and optimized restaurant operations.
